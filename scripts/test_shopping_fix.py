🧪 Test Shopping Context Fix
================================================================================

This script tests the improved shopping context handling where users can say
"Add it to cart" after discussing a product and the system remembers the context.

Testing scenarios:
1. "I want to buy a Samsung phone" -> System finds Samsung Galaxy A24
2. "Add it to cart" -> System should remember Samsung Galaxy A24 from context
